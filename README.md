# Idea for Maze Solver
1. Algo to solve mazes without the importing of images. Eliminates need for intense image segmentation to define the boundaries of the maze.
2. Second objective is to be able to solve mazes from images taken from a phone. Needs high key image segmentation tools since we need to be able to see the boundaries of the maze under different lighting circumstances, shadows, etc.
